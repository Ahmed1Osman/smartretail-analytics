# SmartRetail Analytics Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the SmartRetail Analytics package.

## Example Workflow

The `example_workflow.py` script provides a complete end-to-end example of using the SmartRetail Analytics package to:

1. Load and preprocess data
2. Perform feature engineering
3. Train and evaluate machine learning models
4. Make predictions
5. Visualize results

### Prerequisites

Before running the example, make sure you have installed the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Example

To run the example workflow:

```bash
python example_workflow.py
```

This will execute the workflow and save any generated visualizations to the `output` directory.

## Output

The example script will generate the following outputs:

- **Time Series Plot**: A plot showing the daily order amounts over time
- **Feature Importance Plot**: A plot showing the importance of each feature in the model (if available)
- **Console Output**: Detailed logs of each step in the workflow

## Customizing the Example

You can modify the example script to work with your own data by:

1. Updating the data loading section to read your dataset
2. Adjusting the feature engineering steps to match your data
3. Modifying the model training parameters

## Next Steps

After running the example, you can explore the following:

1. Try different models by modifying the `train_models` function call
2. Add more feature engineering steps
3. Implement hyperparameter tuning
4. Deploy the trained model as an API using the `Predictor` class
